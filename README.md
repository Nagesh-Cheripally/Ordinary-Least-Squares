Ordinary Least Squares or Simple Linear Regression 

A linear regression is a good tool for quick predictive analysis, in order to see the relationship between these variables, we need to build a linear regression, which predicts the line of best fit between them and can help conclude whether or not these two factors have a positive or negative relationship.

The equation has the form Y= a + bX, where Y is the dependent variable (that's the variable that goes on the Y axis), X is the independent variable (i.e. it is plotted on the X axis), b is the slope of the line and a is the y-intercept.



Assumption of Regression Model: 

      - Linearity: The relationship between dependent and independent variables should be linear.
      
      - Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of the errors should be maintained.
      
      - Multivariate normality: Multiple Regression assumes that the residuals are normally distributed.
      
      - Lack of Multicollinearity: It is assumed that there is little or no multicollinearity in the data.
